I just upgraded my iPhone from a 14 Pro Max to an iPhone 15 Pro Max, and this new IPhone 15 Pro Max gets hot so easily. I feel like it over heat in a short period of time. If I knew this, I wouldn’t have upgraded it.

Amazing camera

Shirley P . 2 days ago
Yes, I'd recommend this product.
I went from a iPhone 13 to the 15 pro max.  So far I’m loving the difference. I mostly wanted it for the camera as I used to have the 11 Pro Max. I will say it’s not quite at the level of the Galaxy series but it is pretty amazing. Night pictures come out clear and the zoom is so much better.

Yes, I'd recommend this product.
I love the IPhone 15 Pro Max! I’m still learning all the little tricks, but it’s great. Although the Verizon representative who helped me did a very poor job and tried to charge me twice and didn’t put the right package together so look at everything if you’re getting a new phone.
